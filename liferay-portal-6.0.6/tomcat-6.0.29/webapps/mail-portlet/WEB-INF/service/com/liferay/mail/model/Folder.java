 * The model interface for the Folder service. Represents a row in the &quot;Mail_Folder&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.liferay.mail.model.impl.FolderImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a folder model instance should use the {@link Folder} interface instead.
