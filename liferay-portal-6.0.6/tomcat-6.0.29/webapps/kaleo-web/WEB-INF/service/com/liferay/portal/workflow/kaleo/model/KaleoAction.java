/**
 * The model interface for the KaleoAction service. Represents a row in the &quot;KaleoAction&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.liferay.portal.workflow.kaleo.model.impl.KaleoActionImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a kaleo action model instance should use the {@link KaleoAction} interface instead.
